### :man_technologist: About Me
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Chandler, a passionate particle physicist currently pursuing my PhD at <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a> on the <a href="https://na62.web.cern.ch">NA62 experiment</a>. I study ultra-rare kaon decays analysing large datasets and contributing to the NA62 software framework, written in C++. While my research focuses on exploring the fundamental nature of matter and the universe, I have developed a strong affinity for software development and engineering throughout my academic journey.

Driven by a curiosity to understand complex systems and solve intricate problems, I've honed my analytical skills and attention to detail in the pursuit of scientific discovery. My experience at <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk">CCFE</a> and via my PhD at <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a> has not only deepened my understanding of physics but also exposed me to new technologies and computational methods used in experimental research.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out â€” I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers and exploring new opportunities for collaboration and growth.

  - :telescope: My work uses analyses of compelx big data (incl. machine learning) to search for the ultra-rare decay of a kaon (a type of meson). 

  - :seedling: Planning to move into software engineering with a focus on machine-learning/AI.
  
  - :zap: In my free time I like to challenge myself and program new tools (or just fun) things!
